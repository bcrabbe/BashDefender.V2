Bash defender is an interactive computer game in the ‘Tower Defence’ mould. 
Enemies will advance along a path towards the user’s base. The user will build 
and upgrade towers which attack these enemies. The commands will take the form 
of UNIX terminal, teaching the user basic computing concepts. The objective of 
the game is to survive long enough to complete the level, upgrading your towers
appropriately to deal with increasingly difficult waves of enemies..
